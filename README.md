1)void parseAddition()
Prompts the user to enter two float values (a and b).
Performs addition (a + b) and outputs the result.

2)parseSubtraction()  
Prompts the user to enter two float values (a and b).
Performs subtraction (a - b) and outputs the result.

3) parseMultiplication()
Prompts the user to enter two float values (a and b).
Performs multiplication (a * b) and outputs the result.

 4)parseDivision()  
Prompts the user to enter two float values (a and b).
Performs division (a / b) if b is not zero; otherwise, it avoids division by zero.

 5)parseExponentiation()    
Prompts the user to enter a float (a) and an integer (b).
Calculates a raised to the power of b (a^b) using the pow function from <cmath> and outputs the result.

6) parseSquareRoot()
Prompts the user to enter a float value (a).
Calculates the square root of a using the sqrt function from <cmath> and outputs the result.
